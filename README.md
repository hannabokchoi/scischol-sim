Science scholars research project resources. 
R Shiny app development. 
Here is the app https://bokchoi.shinyapps.io/gwprocesssimulation/

Note: "time" cannot go very high because it will crash. Making anything really high will slow it down a lot.

annotations.R include detailed annotations of the code
app.R is the code used to produce the app (with fewer annotations but otherwise identical)

Thank you to Simon Harris for guiding me along the project and putting up with my code not working!


Special thanks to Sophie Jones for helping me out.
